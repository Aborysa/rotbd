On Start:

CameraPath("camera_path", 2000, 1000, Mammoth), Wave1.  // path_0012
When camera finish: Objective1, White.
SetTarget(Nav 1)
All navs are invincible. (I think this is all RotBD Mission Navs.)

AddHealth Hanger to make it invincible.
AddHealth Supply to make it invincible.

AddAmmo(Player, 1); (every second?) IMPROVEMENT: Give special asuser22 with special sniper rifle, and 100 ammo.

if GetDistance(Player, RadarTower1) < 150, Wave 2.

if(GetDistance(Player, RadarTower1) < 100 then
spawn 2 svhraz, 1 svfigh at spawn_radar1, attack player. //path_0014

?IMPROVEMENT: I Sniped a flanker, drove up to Radar/GTs, killed GTs, was still able to inspect Hanger while Radar was still alive? Maybe need a fail if you get too close before killing it?

if GetDistance(Player, Hanger) < 50, Wave 3/Objective 2 "WHITE".
SetTarget(Nav2)

if GetDistance(Player, RadarTower2) < 150, Wave 2.

if(GetDistance(Player, RadarTower2) < 100 then
spawn 2 svhraz, 1 svfigh at spawn_radar2, attack player. //path_0001

if GetDistance(Player, Supply) < 50, Objective 3 "GREEN". IMPROVEMENT: BUG: Should be white, not green. Should turn green once ur inside the tug.

?IMPROVEMENT: I Went to Nav 2 in a flanker, rand up to hug Radar, blew up everything, including tug. No lose condition for that???? Hmmm.

If IsPerson(Player) and Objective2 triggered, Wave 4/Objective 4 "WHITE". IMPROVEMENT: Wait until player is confirmed to be in the tug? Maybe?
SetTarget(Nav3)

if GetDistance(Player, RadarTower3) < 150, Wave 2.

if(GetDistance(Player, RadarTower3) < 100 then
spawn 2 svhraz, 1 svfigh at spawn_radar3, attack player. //path_0016

When Control Tower is dead, Wave5/Objective 5 "WHITE".
SetTarget(Nav4)

if(GetDistance(Player, Mammoth) < 50? 100?) Objective 6 "WHITE".

After 10 seconds, Wave 6/Objective 7 "GREEN", Objective 8, "WHITE".
StartCockpitTimer(120, 60, 30);
SetTarget(Nav5);

If(GetDistance(Player, Nav5) < 50, SucceedMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn22win.des");

if(GetCockpitTimer() == 0), FailMission(GetTime(), "bdmisn22ls2.des") "You Died." IMPROVEMENT: Writing a new one...

if Mammoth is sniped or destroyed, FailMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn22ls1.des")
