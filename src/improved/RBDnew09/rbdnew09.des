NSDF UPDATE:
The location data recovered from Titan leads us to believe the Cthonian armory we have been hunting is stored on Europa with a cache of other relics related to Canis' research. 

MISSION OBJECTIVES:
- Capture the Cthonian armory.
- Destroy all opposition.

ENGINEERING REPORT:
We have detected anomalous activity in the area that appears to be of Cthonian origin. Be on your toes.
