The ancient Hadean research outpost proved to contain a massive amount of information on Cthonian history, culture, and science and technology. We believe Canis' archives here may be the most complete Cthonian library still in existence. We can't afford to stay here to study it, but we've recovered everything he is able for our return to the moon.
We've also performed an extensive investigation of the alien units you encountered. Comparing them to the data found at the Hadean research base reveals them to be Furies, the ancient superweapon the NSDF and CCA have been racing to reproduce. Canis' data suggests that these Furies are neither reproductions nor the original Hadean versions; instead, the data labels them simply "The Vanguard".
More importantly, though… that was an NSDF base. The documents we discovered confirm it; these aren't communist defectors, they're honest American forces, following orders from NSDF Command. The CCA surrendered, and Shaw hid it from us. He's a traitor… and he's dragged us all down with him.
