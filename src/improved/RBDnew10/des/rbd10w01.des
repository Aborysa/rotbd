The blockade's fire on the Jackson has forced Shaw to retreat, but he's created the opening we needed. The ground is clear, the skies are clear... We're going home. When we make it through we're going to need to report straight to Director Webb. There's no guarantee anyone else will know we're out here, but Webb's the one who put us here and with any luck he'll still be in office. If he can't protect us, help us clear this mess up and help us prove we had no idea Shaw was a traitor, no-one can.
