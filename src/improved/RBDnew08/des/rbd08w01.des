Congratulations, Cobra One. The data Grigg has retrieved indicates the armory has been relocated to Europa, where we believe it is being stored with several other relics related to Canis' project and the Stymphalian Birds. The additional research notes and security protocols he managed to liberate should give us a head start on understanding whatever secrets the armory might be hiding.
