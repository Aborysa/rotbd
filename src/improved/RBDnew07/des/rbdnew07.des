NSDF UPDATE:
The information we have recovered from the crashed Stymphalian Bird leads us to believe that this is where the fighters were built and maintained. Before we lost contact with our surface scouting party they reported the locations of two surface relics that have survived the geological activity in the area; we need you to retrieve them both. We believe the enemy may be making a play for both, so be prepared to fight this one on two fronts.
MISSION OBJECTIVES:
- Escort tug to relic sites.
- Retrieve both relics.
- Bring all relics back to outpost.
ENGINEERING REPORT:
Corporal Baker has reported that the cockpit of the Stymphalian Bird appears to be incompatible with some elements of Cthonian anatomy. Precisely what this means is unclear, but be prepared for surprises.
