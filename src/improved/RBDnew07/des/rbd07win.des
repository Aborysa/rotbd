Baker's examination of the relics you recovered has revealed that they are connected to the Hadean armory the traitors made off with on the moon and the research of a Hadean scientist named Canis. It would seem the Stymphalian Birds were the result of an attempt to create supersoldiers fusing biometal with Cthonian flesh. If the armory has anything to do with this experiment, then we need to find it before the Soviets manage to figure that out.
