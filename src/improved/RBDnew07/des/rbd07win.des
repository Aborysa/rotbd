Good work Cobra One, the relics you captured will give us the edge we need to fend off the NSDF and CCA while we prepare to return to Earth. We believe them to be part of some form of weapon that the Hadean Crown had been developing in tandem with the Furies project. So far all we've been able to gleen is that this weapon was being developed by a scientist named Isis, a name that has not appeared in another database. Whatever it is, at least it didn't fall into the hands of those commie bastards. After what happened on Titan who knows how far they'd go.

The false distress signal that was used against us is troubling, no enemy communications should be able to bypass our IFF systems. It's possible that the system they used to do so is located elsewhere in the solar system, in which case we'll need to find and destroy it ASAP. When we send the relics back to Luna, I want you and your best pilots ready for this next mission.
