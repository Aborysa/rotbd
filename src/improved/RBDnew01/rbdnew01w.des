Well done, Cobra One! Your actions have prevented the Soviets from advancing their weapons research.
Our continued examination of their communications reveals that the scientist we came to rescue was working with the Soviets, and we can only conclude that he is the leader of the communist defectors. It seems Arkin’s treachery runs deeper than we thought. We’ve also determined that the relic the defectors were seen transporting is part of an alien armory of some kind. The research notes suggest the developments made here were passed on to Mars, where the Soviets are developing some kind of mobile superweapon. Commander Shaw is redeploying us there immediately; you’ll be briefed when we arrive.
