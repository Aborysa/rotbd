SITUATION UPDATE:
The Soviets are now fully aware of our presence, so we have to move fast if we're going to steal the Mammoth. The prototype has been moved to the caldera of an extinct volcano, and the immediate area is crawling with Soviet forces so we've dropped you just outside the perimeter. Taking out the research base wasn't enough; the Soviets cannot be allowed to keep the prototype if we're going to stop them from constructing this thing. We need you to get in there and destroy it.

MISSION OBJECTIVES:
- Find and destroy the Mammoth tank.

ENGINEERING REPORT:
Surveillance indicates multiple walker units are patrolling the area, you've been provided two bombers to take them out.
