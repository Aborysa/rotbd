BAKR: Welcome to Mars Cobra One [75]
The superweapon we discovered on the moon is being developed somewhere near here [125] 
its a massive tank called the Mammoth [150] You are going to need to find out where it is first [200] 
theres a hangar just up ahead [10] and your suit should be able to tap into its 
communications so we can listen in [100] Mind the radar towers [50] 
if you stay too close for too long they will realise you are not one of theirs 
and bring all manner of hell down on you [75] Good luck sir[200];
