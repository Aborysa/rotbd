# 0
SE corner
# 1
we could put it in the CCA base, being decoded by the CCA, the player has to break into the base, 
grab the data the CCA collected, destroy the relic and then get out
# 2
we could put it in the original starting zone and move where the player 
spawns to the SW corner, have them move their Recycler to the relic to start 
collecting data, have them sent to attack the CCA base, and then have the attack happen
# 3
we could put it in the SW corner, the original dust off site, 
and instead of that being the dust off site, have an Lpad in the CCA base 
that the player has to bring the survivor APCs to in order to escape, 
fighting off CCA along the way
