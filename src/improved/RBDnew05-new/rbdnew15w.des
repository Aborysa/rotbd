The destruction of the Stymphalian Bird was unfortunate, but necessary. Although the base was destroyed we successfully evacuated our forces, retrieved the information we came for and destroyed several key Soviet structures on the planet's surface.

Baker's team have already started turning up results from analysing the relic. The Stymphalian Birds were not just an adversary of the Hercules Brigade; they were designed to be their nemeses, a fighter squadron designed to wipe them out for good. Apparently this particular Bird was on its way back to a base on Io for repairs; that must be where they were built.
