Nav4: label_0005


On Start:

SetScrap(1, 10)
SetPilot(1, 5)
spawn 1 svrecy(path_0003) and 2 sbtowe(path_0001, path_0002) 
Wave1/Objective 1, white. 
3 svfigh spawn (path_0005, path_006, path_0007). Goto path_0019.
SetObjectiveOn(Recycler);

Before objective 7:
if GetDistance(Player, Recycler) > 700, FailMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn21ls1.des");
addhealth to svrecy, and both sbtowe. (IMPROVEMENT: To make truly invincible, save maxhealth, SetMaxHealth(h, 0), then after objective 7 SetMaxHealth back to saved value).

When recycler deploys, objective 1 green, objective 2 white.

When recycler deploys, after 120 seconds, spawn 2 svfigh (path_0005, path_0006), Goto path_0019.

When 2nd scavenger is complete, Objective 2 green, objective 3 white.
spawn 2 svfigh, (path_000C, path_000D), goto path_0018.

When scrap is >= 20, clear objectives, objective 4 white.

When factory is complete, objective 4 green, objective 5 white.
spawn 2 svfigh, (path_000C, path_000D), goto path_0018.

When built 3 new tanks and 1 new bomber, objective 5 green, objective 6 white.
2 more svfigh(path_000C, path_000D), does nothing, never commanded by script. (Bug in original? Goto path_0018)
2 sbspow(path_000E, path_000F) 
2 svscav(path_000A, path_000B)

When 3 turrets built, objective 6 green.
spawn 2 svfigh(path_0010, path_0011). Goto path_001A.

45 seconds after 3 turrets built, Objective 7 white, wave 2. 
SetObjectiveOn(svrecy), SetObjectiveOn(sbtowe1), SetObjectiveOn(sbtowe2)
svrecy, and sbtowes no longer addhealth.
SetObjectiveOff(Recy)? (needs confirmation)

When both GT's are destroyed:
SetObjectiveOff(svrecy).
---spawn 2 svfigh(path_0008, path_0009), ??? nope? triggered by something else? Never occured for me? -- INVESTIGATE THIS. Omit for now. might have mistaken a different spawn.
spawn 3 avwalk(path_0013, path_0014, path_0015), goto path_001B.
spawn 2 avtank(path_0016, path_0004), goto(path_001B? path_0017?), (far tank: Goto path_0018).
CameraPath path_0017 target: avwalk(@path_0015) (one heading to recy),
SetObjectiveOn all attackers. 
SetObjectiveOn Recycler.
Wave 3, objecitve 8 white. 

When all attackers are dead, nothing happens, mission objectives don't update. IMPROVEMENT: Re-direct to destroy svrecy/setobjectiveon svrecy again?

When enemy recy is dead, clear objectives, objective 9.

When comm tower is built, SucceedMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn21win.des");

If your recycler is destroyed, FailMission(GetTime(), "bdmisn21ls2.des");
