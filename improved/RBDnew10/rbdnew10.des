SITUATION UPDATE:
Everything is coming together. We've stopped the Soviets from finishing the Mammoth and we've kept the data from Canis' work out of their hands. It's time to go home.

MISSION OBJECTIVES:
- Await the construction of the launch pad.
- Defend the base.

ENGINEERING REPORT:
Baker's team has finished reverse-engineering the Soviet Mammoth and drawn up schematics for a version of our own. We've also detected signals in the area that match the "Vanguard" we encountered on Europa. Be careful.
