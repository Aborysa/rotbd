It's unfortunate that we were discovered before we could destroy the prototype, but the information you have gathered should be enough to allow us to locate it again once the Soviets have hidden it somewhere else. Corporal Baker's team have set to work deciphering it - hopefully it should also shed some more light on the origins of the technology behind this project.
