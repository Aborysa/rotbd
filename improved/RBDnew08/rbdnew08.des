NSDF UPDATE:
If we're going to track down the stolen Hadean armory, we need to find out where it is first. Its location is being held at a massive and well-secured base on Titan, so we're going to need a two-pronged assault to recover it. With any luck we can use this opportunity to cause some serious damage to the Soviets' operations.
MISSION OBJECTIVES:
- Disrupt the outpost defenses.
- Disable the Soviet comm towers.
- Rendezvous with Private Grigg at the pickup zone.
ENGINEERING REPORT:
There are several American howitzer units on the mountain ridges. These will need to be taken out before the comm towers can be secured. Do not attempt to approach the base itself.
