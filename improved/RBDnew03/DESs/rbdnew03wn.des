Excellent work, Lieutenant. Between this prototype and the schematics you retrieved, we can get the engineers to start work on our own version. When it’s complete, it should give us a healthy advantage against the Soviets.

While you were in the field, Corporal Baker’s team finished decrypting the reports you brought back. Apparently the Mammoth is heavily based on Cthonian technology - specifically, a Hadean craft called the Stymphalian Bird. We don’t know anything else about them, but our grasp of Ancient Greek mythology suggests they were an adversary of the Hercules Brigade. It looks like the Soviets haven’t been able to find one of these craft yet, but there was a list of potential co-ordinates with the reports. We’re cross-referencing that with other locations now, in the hope of finding one before the Soviets can.
